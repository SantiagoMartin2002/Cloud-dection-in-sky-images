# Sun tracking

The position of the sun relative to cloud cover could provide useful information for predicting the power output of a solar PV system. This repo offers a method for identifying the sun position in a sky image taken from a ground-based fish-eye camera. The figure blow demonstrates the results of our sun tracking algorithm for three different sky conditions and the position of the sun in each image is indicated by the red spot.
